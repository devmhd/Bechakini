# Bechakini

Bechakini is an android application, being developed as a participant of the Code-Warriors Challenge 2015.

##Dependencies
* [Crouton] 

##Special Notes

Since developing backend is not a priority of this project, a super simple and minimalistic REST API is used. The server accepts login requests only with the following credentials.

>Email: **abc@demo.com**  
>Password: **123** 

All other login requests are denied.

Server also accepts all signup requests.
